**14 August â€“ The Beginning**  
Our first text.  
Like the starting point in a chaotic system small, but it changed everything.

---

**29 August â€“ A Beautiful Disruption**  
You proposed.  
Two variables drifted apart from normal emotions began to swirl and dance.

---

**5 September â€“ Orbit Locked**  
We got together.  
Even in chaos, we found each other constantly moving, yet always drawn back.

---

**15 November â€“ First Touch of Stability**  
Our first kiss.  
The system found rhythm. A single moment settled into something unforgettable.

---

**27 January â€“ Long Distance Begins**  
A disturbance.  
New forces entered, but our connection stayed strong steady through the storm.

---

**18 August â€“ A Full Circle**  
Your birthday.  
The system loops not repeating, but growing. Our love, evolving with time.
